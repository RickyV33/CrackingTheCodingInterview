## About

This will contain all the practice problem's that I work through in Cracking the Coding Interview book. All problems are first designed, implemented, and tested on paper before being transferred over to Java. I expect to do at least one algorithmic problem a day in order to refine my problem solving skills.

## Development

### Process

I'm reading through [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi45tvAzKvQAhUKzmMKHfViBqMQFghEMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions%2Fdp%2F098478280X&usg=AFQjCNFTJ34Rv_Q_Qvg55ufNaJG_ozlrig&sig2=42P_aA-6y6c_kemOLRWSFg). As I work through the problems on paper, I will transfer them into this code base to test if they compile.
