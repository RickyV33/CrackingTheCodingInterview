## About

This will contain all the practice problem's that I work through in Cracking the Coding Interview book. All problems are first designed, implemented, and tested on paper before being transferred over to Java. I expect to do at least one algorithmic problem a day in order to refine my problem solving skills.

## Development

### Process

I'm reading through [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X). As I work through the problems on paper, I will transfer them into this code base to test if they compile.
